# potpourri
A grab-bag of potentially useful scripts and half-ideas

This repository exists for me to practice coding and git, and at the present does not have a focus. Maybe its contents will eventually grow into a larger, dedicated project. Time will tell.


# readtime.py
readtime prints the ctime of a file in human-readable format. ctime is the closest thing Linux has to a file creation date. Oftentimes it is the actual creation date of a file, but there are commands which can change this value, and therefore no proper creation date exists. readtime was created to test a section of code for use in filebydate.py.
